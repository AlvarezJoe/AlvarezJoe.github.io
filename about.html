                    <h2>Hello, I'm Joemichael</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a <span class="highlight">Senior Data Scientist</span> at Lennar, where I build production-ready 
                        AI systems that deliver measurable business impact. Based in Miami, Florida, I specialize in MLOps, 
                        machine learning, and scalable data solutions that solve complex enterprise challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech, I hold a 
                        Bachelor's in Data Analytics from Miami Dade College. My experience spans from financial analytics 
                        at Boeing Distribution Services to leading AI initiatives at Lennar, where I focus on 
                        <span class="highlight">enterprise-scale ML systems</span> and production deployments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What drives me is creating intelligent systems that streamline operations 
                        and deliver real business value. From developing enterprise-scale AI customer service agents to 
                        implementing MLOps infrastructure with drift monitoring and automated retraining pipelines, 
                        I focus on building reliable, scalable solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My recent work includes developing <span class="highlight">AI-powered chatbot systems</span> currently in MVP stage, 
                        along with building unstructured data pipelines that transform PDFs into actionable insights 
                        using LLMs and OCR technology. I specialize in taking experimental models from concept to production-ready systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not building models or optimizing pipelines, you'll find me exploring the latest 
                        developments in AI research, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring aspiring data scientists.

                        I get excited about taking models from Jupyter notebooks to production systems 
                        that actually solve real problems, not just look good in presentations.

                        Every dataset has a story to tell. I love uncovering insights that change how

                        The best models are often the simplest ones that solve the problem well. 
                        I prefer elegant solutions over complex ones that impress but don't deliver.
